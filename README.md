##Early Watercraft

Early Watercraft is a research project at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, that has deployed Arches to present information on early Slovenian logboats and potentially provide a framework to manage and publish data on early watercraft throughout the world.

####Installation:

You can install this app just like any other arches app; it is a modified version of the HIP app used for historicplacesla.org.  Begin by following the normal Arches HIP installation [instructions](http://arches-hip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/#installating-arches-hip).  At step #5, where you must create a new app, clone this repository instead, using the following command (you may need to install git first):

        git clone https://github.com/bojankastelic/ew.git

Now continue with the installation instructions, substituting `ew` for `my_hip_app` wherever the latter occurs, because "ew" is now the name of your app.
